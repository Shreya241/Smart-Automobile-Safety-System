# IoT-based Smart-Automobile-Safety-System

In this study, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for accident prevention, prediction, detection, and alerting. The system aims to lower the rate of traffic accidents by utilizing various sensors installed in a car and an IoT platform for data interpretation.

## Features

- Seatbelt sensor: Detects seatbelt usage.
- Alcohol sensor: Measures blood alcohol content.
- Temperature sensor: Monitors environmental temperature.
- Pressure sensor: Measures atmospheric pressure.
- Accelerometer and gyroscope sensors: Detect changes in car's motion.
- Rainfall sensor: Monitors weather conditions.
- Vibration sensor: Detects vehicle vibrations.
- GPS module: Provides real-time location tracking.
- GSM module: Sends notifications to emergency agencies and family members.

## System Architecture

The IoT platform gathers data from the sensors and interprets it to identify potential accident factors such as seatbelt usage, blood alcohol content, environmental conditions, and driving behavior. In case of an accident, the system can send real-time notifications with the vehicle's precise location to family members and emergency services using the GSM module.

## Usage

To use this system, you need the following components:

- Proteus: Simulator for hardware testing.
- Arduino or compatible microcontroller: to interface with the sensors.
- IoT platform: for data gathering and interpretation.
- GPS and GSM modules: for real-time location tracking and notifications.

1. Install Proteus and set up the required components.
2. Connect the sensors to the microcontroller following the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the Proteus code provided in this repository to the microcontroller.
4. Set up and configure the IoT platform to receive and interpret sensor data.
5. Connect the GPS and GSM modules to the microcontroller according to the hardware specifications.
6. Test the system in different settings to evaluate its effectiveness in accident prevention and detection.

## Results

We have tested the suggested technique in several settings and achieved good success in identifying accidents and delivering instant alarms. By analyzing the data gathered from the sensors, the system can also predict future collisions and notify the driver to take appropriate safety measures.
